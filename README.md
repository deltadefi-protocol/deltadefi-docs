# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

DeltaDeFi is a decentralized exchange built with Hydra, a Cardano L2 technology, to enable High-Frequency Trading (HFT) on Cardano.&#x20;



### Why is there no serious trading in Cardano DeFi?

Decentralized Exchange Slippage Issue, Integration Pain & Order Management Cost&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Challenges in decentralized exchanges, such as slippage, technical complexities, and high order management costs, hinder professional traders. AMMs increase slippage, and HFT faces issues with high transaction finality and gas fees.



### DeltaDeFi solves the fundamentals of DeFi trading

Centralized exchanges prove their product market fit by having a seamless trading experience. DeltaDeFi aims to build a non-custodial version of it, including matching speed and price. We believe we can only level up the DeFi ecosystem back to the industry standard with the fundamentals solved:

**Instant Order Confirmation**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Zero Order Placing / Cancelling Cost**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Programmatic Access / API Trading**
{% endhint %}



With the above solution, speed and API trading can be realized, and closing the user experience gap between CeFi and DeFi

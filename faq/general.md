# General

## Roadmap

<details>

<summary>Wen launch?</summary>

We expect the core feature development will be completed in 2025 Q3. A large part of the uncertainty is that we have to ensure the Hydra Head protocol is sufficiently stable to use. On that end, our team is trying our best to work closely to communicate the minimally blocking bugs/features we need to launch. Some example issues we are working on, but not limited to

* [Networking issue between heads](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1773)
* [Enabling withdrawal in Hydra](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1757)
* [False errors reported by Hydra](https://github.com/cardano-scaling/hydra/issues/1871)

<summary>Any token for DeltaDeFi?</summary>

We have a token plan, but right now it is still in the early stage that we don't have the exact tokenomics fleshed out.&#x20;

The initial plan, subject to frequent change, for token is to serve 2 purposes:

* Enable funding to support decentralizing the protocol
* Use as a medium to engage the Cardano community, fostering feedback loop and bootstraping early use community

</details>

<details>

<summary>Any plans to go multi-chain?</summary>

No. While we thought of the multi-chain strategy in the early days, now we are more in a stage of focusing on the technology itself and bringing as much sought-after trading experience to the Cardano community natively, before considering diluting our focus.

## Design

<details>

<summary>Why Cardano?</summary>

Our team is deeply rooted in the Cardano ecosystem. We build on Cardano of course, since we love Cardano. But more importantly, our understanding of Cardano enables us to build products that fill gaps in DeFi, which is a unique opportunity that exists in the Cardano ecosystem.

<details>

<summary>Why order book?</summary>

In the realm of trading, we believe the order book model is the true model that servesthe  actual demand of trading and stands the test of time. As a project aims to bridge the gap between centralized trading experience with the DeFi world, we have then chosen order book model to build the decentralized exchange.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why Hydra?</summary>

In order to trade with speed and bring as close user experience to centralized services as possible, we have to build on top of any available scaling technology. So far, Hydra is the only scaling technology that works on Cardano. After accessing factors like potential features, supports, and limitations, we decided that Hydra is a technology that meets the bar of DeltaDeFi's need, and then started investing in this technology.

## Hydra

<details>

<summary>What is the relationship between DeltaDeFi and Hydra team?</summary>

There is no relationship. Apart from the fact that DeltaDeFi is one of a few teams that is actively building on top of Hydra and providing actual user feedback to the Hydra team. DeltaDeFi is like a community member in the Hydra family.

</details>

<details>

<summary>I have heard about the Hydra Head protocol being custodial. Is my fund deposited into DeltaDeFi safe?</summary>

Hydra's fund safety comes from "at least one honest participant". Achieving sufficient decentralization in Hydra comes with some decisions on who could host the DeltaDeFi Hydra node and open-sourcing the infrastructure.

Given that the decentralization of how we use Hydra can be improved over time, and also with limited funding, our team decides to focus every resource possible on bringing the right product to Cardano at first.

We will start testing by hosting all nodes and then invite trusted community parties to host part of the Hydra nodes. DeltaDeFi will become more and more decentralized as times go by, and eventually a fully decentralized DApp for the community.

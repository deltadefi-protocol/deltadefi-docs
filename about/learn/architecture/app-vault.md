# App Vault

All user fund in DeltaDeFi sits on a single validator address - App Vault. When you send funds to the App Vault address, you can create an on-chain proof of asset ownership record.  With that proof, you can redeem the equivalent asset value from the App Vault. In this session, we will dive deeper into what exactly you are trading on DeltaDeFi, given all values are sitting on the same address all the time.

### Depositing

Depositing is an action where there is actual value inflow to the App Vault. At the time of deposit, users can create a distinct proof of asset ownership.

### Trading

Trading is then a notion of users trading against each other's proof of asset ownership, with the underlying asset value itself untouched.

### Withdrawal

Withdrawal is an action where there is actual value outflow from the App Vault. At the time of withdrawal, users can use their proof of asset ownership to redeem assets out of the DeltaDeFi validator system.
